Hello Ben Switalski,

In order to run this app on your local build machine you first need to download and install npm. There are a couple of different ways that you can do that here at https://nodejs.org/en/download

Then run the following commands. 

npm install

npm run build

npm run dev

Every file comes from the template at https://github.com/sveltejs/template (I know its old but I used it on some other stuff)

with the exception of the only file that I touched or edited myself is at src\App.svelte
