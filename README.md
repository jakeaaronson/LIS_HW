Hello Ben Switalski,
To run this app on your local machine, please follow these steps:

First, download and install Node.js and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal
Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This project is based on the Svelte template from https://github.com/sveltejs/template. (I know its old but I used it on some other stuff)
The file you should examine is src/App.svelte, which contains the custom code for this application. Its the only one I edited from the template. 
There was some ambiguity If you'd like to see some server-side code, I can provide more code upon request. I've been playing around with Firestore recently and can add that in or another backend tech. 
Let me know if you need any clarification or have questions!
